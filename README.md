PROJECT TITLE : **Disease Prediction Toolkit:Building and Evaluating ML Models**

📝DESCRIPTION:
Develop a Disease Prediction Toolkit by training machine learning models (e.g., logistic
regression, random forest) to predict diseases using real-world health datasets. This
project guides beginners to analyze data, build accurate models, and document results
in a professional portfolio for healthcare AI/ML roles.


🔶FEATURES:

Data preprocessing

Training Machine learning Models for disease prediction

Model Evaluation with Accuracy and metrics

Model Optimization

Live prediction


📍TECHNOLOGY USED:
